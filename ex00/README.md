# Simple Arithmetic Calculator

## Task:

> Write a **`C`** program that takes two integers and an arithmetic operator `(+, -, *, / )` as input, and then perform the corresponding operation. The program should print the result of the operation.

## Requirements: 

- Use a 'switch' statement to hadndle the differwnt operations.
- Handle division carefully, ensuring that you don't divid by zero .
- Print an error message if the user enters an invalid operator.

## Example:
  

>*Input* : `5, 3, +`
<br>
*Output* : `5 + 3 = 8`
---
> *Input* : `10, 0, /`
<br>
*Output* : `Error: Division by zero.`
---

> *Input* : `7, 2, $` 
<br>
*Output* : `Error: Invalid operator.`


## Hints:

- You can use ***scanf*** to read user input.
- Make sure to check the operator before preforming the calculation.
